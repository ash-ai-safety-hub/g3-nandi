# Comparing Optimization Targets for Contrast Consistent Search

## Abstract

We explore the optimization target of Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), a technique designed to recover the internal representations of truth in large language models. This research introduces a novel loss function known as Midpoint-Displacement (MD) loss. We demonstrate that, with a specific hyper-parameter value, the MD loss function yields a prober with weights similar to CCS. However, we also show that this hyper-parameter is suboptimal, and with a better value, the MD loss function achieves a higher test accuracy compared to CCS.
